**CENTRALIZATION IS STRENGTH** The poster called out from the wall it was taped to as DevCon4 attendees walking by pointed and wondered aloud what the message meant. The URL at the bottom provided a hint, once entered into a web browser: www.unfreedom.org. | **Decentralized organizations just got real.** We released Aragon 0.5 seven months ago. Since then, more than 2,500 organizations have been created with it. Counting all Aragon versions, the total number of Aragon organizations now adds up to 15,000+. | **The next step in decentralizing Aragon's development.** Earlier this year we set the path for decentralizing Aragon's development. And, after half a year, our vision is already a reality. There are two teams working on Aragon's development already: Aragon One and Aragon DAC. |

**An intro to the principles of governance.** Every collective action whether it is a small group or a vast nation-state follows a governance process. Sometimes this process is formalized, well-documented, and rigid. Other times it is so fluid and informal that it is difficult to observe. The purpose of this post is not to prescribe or analyze any specific process or method for governing, as governance is contextual. | **A Lesson on Governance With Practical Examples** At a high level, blockchain governance refers to the mechanisms by which decentralized networks adapt and change over time. While blockchain networks should be intelligently designed, it’s only natural that new considerations are uncovered once a protocol has been tested by the public. | **If 2017 was a year when fundraising for decentralized protocols dominated headlines, 2018’s emerging narrative is about empowering investors.**  From fits and starts on ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake to Tezos’ launch, governance has been one of the persistent conversations in crypto this year. But for all the promise, one long awaited approach to blockchain governance, Decred’s Politeia software, went live today at 1300 UTC. |
